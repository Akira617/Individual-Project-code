 Put the CASIA-Webface and VGG2 datasets downloaded from Google Cloud in the root directory
 First run makedata.py to construct the mask data set. Set the original data set path and the new data set path in this file
 Through my Google cloud link,you can get the dataset named CASIA-Webface_Disguised or VGG2_Disguised
 Then run build_triple to construct the load file of the ternary data set
 Next, run train.py for training
 Finally run the testmodel.py to obtain test results
